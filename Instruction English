Description: Write a program that asks the user: the number of kilometers to be traveled, the age of the passenger.
Based on this information, it must calculate the total ticket price according to the following rules: the ticket price is defined based on kilometers (â‚¬0.21 per km),
a 20% discount is applied for minors, a 40% discount is applied for seniors over 65. 

MILESTONE 1: Let's start by implementing the program without any aesthetics: using only two inputs and a button (not styled), 
we will meet the specifications written above. The final response (or output) will also be written in the console.

MILESTONE 2: Once milestone 1 is complete and functional, 
we will create a form on the page where the user can input data and view the final calculation with the price. 
The summary of the data and the output of the final price will then need to be displayed on the page (the price should be formatted with a maximum of two decimal places to indicate cents). 
This will require a minimum of research.

MILESTONE 3: Now that the logic is functional on the page, we can focus on styling, 
refining the HTML and CSS to make it aesthetically pleasing.
